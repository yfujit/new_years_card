# New Year 2026 Greeting | Specification

## Concept
The theme for 2026 is "**Specification**".

We aim to set more concrete goals and move forward steadily, step by step. Clear specifications serve as a roadmap that eliminates ambiguity and leads to certain results.

Just as small accumulations create great changes, we hope to build our ideal future step by step through detailed planning and steady execution.

## Technologies Used
All code and visual content for this website were created using the following AI technologies:

- **Kiro** - AI-powered IDE with Spec Coding and optimization
  - Systematic development process from requirements definition to design and implementation
  - Advanced reasoning capabilities for creating optimized and accessible code

- **nijijourney** - Anime-style AI-generated visual content
  - All visual content generated in high-quality animation style
